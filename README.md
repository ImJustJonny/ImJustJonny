**Introduction**
I'm Jonathon Russell, a 24-year-old student at Wake Technical Community College. The challenges of COVID sparked my fascination with Cloud Computing, environment creation, and coding. I'm eagerly seeking internship opportunities for the summer of 2024 to apply my growing skills, contribute meaningfully, and continue learning from industry professionals in the field.
